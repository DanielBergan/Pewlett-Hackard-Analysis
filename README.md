# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the amount of employees who will be ready to retire 
in the near future with special attention being paid to those who are preparing to retire from
leadership roles. We are also looking for potential cadidate to be participate in a mentorship
program to fill said vacant roles.

## Analysis Results

- There is a sizable amount of employees set to retire.
- Many of the vacancies will be senior level positons.
- There isn't nearly enough employees eligible for a mentorship program.
- The scope of employees included in the mentorship program will need to be expanded.

## Summary

According to the data there will be 72000 positions needing to be filled in the coming years.
As it stands now there does not seem to be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the 
departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

Furthermore, it is recommended that there are additional queries made into the salaries of the 
departing employees and the salaries of the employees who might potentially replace them to adjust
the upcoming budget.
